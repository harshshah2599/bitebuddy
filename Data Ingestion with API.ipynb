Compared to other restaurants, they are very inexpensive and great quality and quantity for that price. We have been going to this place for almost a year now and still we don't get tired. Nice place and great customer service, food is ready within minutes. Worth a try. delicious and fast. cash only for charges under $15. small portion is plenty for me. the food is pretty good and pretty cheep with the buy one get the same thing half off. i got dumpings, crab rangoons and pork fried rice. the rice was eh but the other two were excellent.
